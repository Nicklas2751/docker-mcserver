# Docker Minecraft Server

Run minecraft vanilla server in a docker container :whale:.

## Get started

A image in the docker repo is coming soon.
For now there is no pre-built image in the docker repo but you can easily build it by yourself ;):

If you have not already, go ahead and [install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

1. clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/dafriedmann/docker-mcserver.git
```
2. use docker-compose to build
```
docker-compose build
```

3. use docker-compose to start
```
docker-compose up -d
```
